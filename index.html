    <p>Welcome to my Web Development journey. This is a webiste that will <em>demonstrate</em>
       the skills i have learned from each lesson of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">
       The Odin Project</a> and it will be filled with content from the lessons throughout this course.</p> 

    <h3>Examples of Lists</h3>
    <p> I have created a navigation bar below containing links to pages withing this webiste demonstrating the use of ordered 
        and unordered lists, using the examples <strong>The Odin Project</strong> provided for the content. In each of these pages images have been used
    to demonstrate the ability to input an image.</p>
<!-- When I know how, create a button or drop down that takes you to the page of where the examples of lists are. -->
