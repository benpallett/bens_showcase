    <p>Welcome to my Web Development journey. This is a webiste that will <em>demonstrate</em>
       the skills i have learned from each lesson of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">
       The Odin Project</a> and it will be filled with content from the lessons throughout this course.</p> 

    <h3>Examples of Lists</h3>
    <p> I have created a navigation bar below containing links to pages withing this webiste demonstrating the use of ordered 
        and unordered lists, using the examples <strong>The Odin Project</strong> provided for the content. As of writing, I have played around with the 
        'flex' function for the layout of the navigation bar. In each of these pages, images have been used to demonstrate the ability to input an image into 
        a webpage.</p>
<!-- When I know how, create a button or drop down that takes you to the page of where the examples of lists are. -->
